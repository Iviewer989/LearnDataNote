## 01 question and answer



In the below content, i have two question, one: why the author say  "In this case, it was the owner of the bike who would get fornicated, when I handed him the bill."two: what is the way ? give  me some example, in "my own Ph.D. dissertation proceeded in a way similar to the Magna oil seal episode".

the content:
There is something perverse at work here, and I would like to understand it. That oil seal was the opening to Pandora’s box: I felt compelled to get to the bottom of things, to gape them open and clean them out. But this lust for thoroughness is at odds with the world of human concerns in which the bike is situated, where all that matters is that the bike works. The bike is for riding, and riding motorcycles competes for resources with other purposes the owner surely has. This more holistic, pragmatic view of the motorcycle is the one where economics becomes salient. It grounds the fiduciary responsibility of the mechanic to the owner. In digging at that oil seal heedlessly, I was acting out of some need of my own. The curious man is always a fornicator, according to Saint Augustine. In this case, it was the owner of the bike who would get fornicated, when I handed him the bill.

One theologian writes that “curiosity’s desire is closed, limited by the object it wants to know considered in isolation: the knowledge curiosity seeks is wanted as though it were the only thing to be had.”2 The problem with such fixation is that the mechanic’s activity, properly understood, is practical in character, rather than curious or theoretical. As such it must be disciplined by a circumspect regard for others, a kind of fiduciary consciousness. Amy Gilbert writes that practical wisdom entails “the full appreciation of the salient moral features of the particular situations we confront. Our awareness of these features enables us to respond properly to them.”3 Acquiring practical wisdom, then, entails overcoming the self-absorption of the idiot, but also the tunnel vision of the curious man whose attention is indeed directed outside of himself, but who sees only his own goal. A lot of academic work has this quality of curiosity without circumspection; my own Ph.D. dissertation proceeded in a way similar to the Magna oil seal episode. But with the Magna I had to give an account to the customer.
The metaphysician often takes a dim view of economic exchange. It is the realm of mere agreement and conventional valuations, rather than intrinsic qualities. But agreement and convention, if consulted, provide a helpful check on your own subjectivity—they offer proof that you are not insane, or at least a more robust presumption to that effect. Some of us need such proof more than others, and getting paid for what you love to do can provide it. Going into business is good therapy for the feeling that there is something arbitrary and idiosyncratic in your grasp of the world, and therefore that your actions within it are unjustified.
The oil seal turned out to be one that, of course, could be replaced only from the inside—a huge job. I ended up pulling the final drive unit (the Magna is shaft-driven) and the swing arm to replace that oil seal. Doing so gave me great satisfaction. But like that of the fornicator, this pleasure brought a surge of bad conscience in its wake. In the end I knocked the labor bill from $2,200 down to $1,500. This entailed a belated recognition that the quality of being wide-awake, of being a clear-sighted person who looks around and sees the whole situation, isn’t something I can take for granted in myself. It is something that needs to be achieved on a moment-to-moment basis. The presence of others in a shared world makes this both possible and necessary.

what does it mean ? give me some examples about "Maybe we can say, after all, that higher education is indispensable to prepare students for the jobs of the information economy. Not for the usual reason given, namely, that there is ever-increasing demand for workers with more powerful minds, but in this perverse sense: college habituates young people to accept as the normal course of things a mismatch between form and content, official representations and reality. This cannot be called cynicism if it is indispensable to survival in the contemporary office, as it was in the old Soviet Union."

the article:

If I had pursued higher education for the sake of a career, it would have turned out to be a complete mistake; happily, this was not my situation, and I have no regrets about my studies. But many people seem to regard college, and even graduate school, as an extension of compulsory schooling. More than 90 percent of high school students “report that their guidance counselors encouraged them to go to college.”14
In this there is little accommodation of the diversity of dispositions, and of the fact that some very smart people are totally ill suited both to higher education and to the kind of work you’re supposed to do once you have a degree. Further, funneling everyone into college creates certain perversities in the labor market.
The sociologist of education Randall Collins describes a cycle of credential inflation that “could go on endlessly, until janitors need Ph.D.’s and babysitters are required to hold advanced degrees in child care.”15 The escalating demand for academic credentials gives the impression of an ever more knowledgeable society, whose members perform cognitive feats their unschooled parents could scarcely conceive of. Consider my abstracting job as it might have been described by a business journalist steeped in the latest talk about a “postindustrial society” or “creative economy.” I perfectly exemplified the knowledge worker, and what’s more, I had an advanced degree to match. My very existence, multiplied a millionfold, is precisely what puts the futurologist in a rapture: we are getting to be so smart! Yet, in viewing my situation from afar in this way, the M.A. degree serves only to obscure a more real stupidification of the work I secured with that credential, and a wage to match. What the hell is going on? Is this our society as a whole, buying more education only to scale new heights of stupidity?
If much corporate knowledge work is after all not terribly demanding on the brain, or even requires the active suppression of intelligence, then we would expect academic accomplishments to be a poor basis on which to make hiring decisions. And in fact, corporate recruiters say they care little about a student’s grades. The university itself is trusted to have done more than enough cognitive sorting on the day it admitted a student. In their book Higher Education and Corporate Realities, the sociologists Phillip Brown and Richard Scase quote one recruiter saying, “We find no correlation at all between your degree result and how well you get on in this company. Not at all. I wish there were. I would then be able to say, ‘Unless you’ve got [a good GPA], don’t bother.’”16
The irrelevance of what you actually learn (or don’t) in school for job performance is hard to square with a technocratic view of the economy, which is invariably coupled with a sunny presumption of meritocracy. Together, these views sometimes go by the name of “human capital theory.” According to this theory, “schools help society get the skills that it needs while they help individuals get the social positions that they deserve,” as David Labaree put it in How to Succeed in School Without Really Learning: The Credential Race in American Education.17
This technocratic/meritocratic view strikes us today as common sense, but it is predicated on a certain view of what education is for, one that arose in the last century. In the years after World War II, many observers were struck with how complex society was becoming. The rational and scientific administration of this complexity seemed imperative; mere common sense seemed a paltry thing, totally inadequate to the challenges of a modern economy. Many business executives who were doing the hiring in the postwar years lacked degrees themselves, and assumed that college graduates would make superior employees because they possessed super-duper skills and knowledge. They were eager to hire college graduates to do jobs that had long been done by people with only high school diplomas. Yet there was little evidence to show they were better at their jobs, and in many cases they were less so. In a famous study of air traffic controllers, a job requiring complex decision making, for example, the sociologist Ivar Berg found an inverse correlation between educational achievement and job performance.18
Further, the technocratic/meritocratic view of education treats it as instrumental—it is good for society, and for getting ahead—and this has a corrupting effect on genuine education. As Labaree writes, “Formal characteristics of schooling—such as grades, credits, and degrees—come to assume greater weight than substantive characteristics, as pursuing these badges of merit becomes more important than actually learning anything along the way. . . . Teaching takes a back seat to the more socially salient task of sorting, and grading becomes more important for its social consequences than for its pedagogical uses.”19
Pedagogically, you might want to impress on a student the miserable state of his mind. You might want to improve the student by first crushing him, as then you can recruit his pride to the love of learning. You might want to reveal to him the chasm separating his level of understanding from the thinkers of the ages. You do this not out of malice, but because you sense rare possibilities in him, and take your task to be that of cultivating in the young man (or woman) a taste for the most difficult studies. Such studies are likely to embolden him against timid conventionality, and humble him against the self-satisfaction of the age, which he wears on his face. These are the pedagogical uses of the “D.” But give someone a low grade, and he is likely to press upon you the fact that his admission to law school hangs in the balance. The Sort is on.
With this attitude, students are merely adapting themselves to the marketlike ethic of the institutions that school them. “Educational institutions find themselves located in a hierarchy of their own, forced to compete with other institutions for position in order to enhance the marketability of their credentials to socially mobile consumers.”20 The result is “a growing emphasis on producing selective symbolic distinctions rather than shared substantive accomplishments.”21 That is, what matters is your rank among your peers; it matters not if the whole lot of you are ignorant. When the point of education becomes the production of credentials rather than the cultivation of knowledge, it forfeits the motive recognized by Aristotle: “All human beings by nature desire to know.” Students become intellectually disengaged.
Maybe we can say, after all, that higher education is indispensable to prepare students for the jobs of the information economy. Not for the usual reason given, namely, that there is ever-increasing demand for workers with more powerful minds, but in this perverse sense: college habituates young people to accept as the normal course of things a mismatch between form and content, official representations and reality. This cannot be called cynicism if it is indispensable to survival in the contemporary office, as it was in the old Soviet Union.
Thirty years ago, Collins pointed out that higher education serves a signaling function: it rewards and certifies the display of middle-class self-discipline. But what sort of discipline is required of white-collar workers these days? Once upon a time, the passing of examinations, meeting of course deadlines, and disciplined study for the sake of mastering a body of knowledge broadcast a willingness to conform to organizational discipline, and displayed the dispositions needed to develop competence in a bureaucracy. But the new antibureaucratic ideal of the flexible organization puts quite different demands on people, requiring the cultivation of a different sort of self. As Brown and Scase point out, in the new dispensation the whole person is at issue; one has to have certain personal qualities, more than a well-defined set of competencies tied to the fulfillment of specific organizational ends. What the recruiters are looking for is a manner of personal comportment, a collection of psychological and social aptitudes, that is difficult to codify. (This makes sense for a workplace that has little in the way of objective standards such as one finds in a machine shop.) Accordingly, the credentialism of higher education can continue its signaling function only if the official items appearing on a transcript are supplemented with extracurricular items that signal the possession of a complete personality package.22 Students and their parents seem to understand this. An important part of the package is that one be a joiner, as this signals the possession of a self that is ready for “teamwork.”



作者的论点本质上是对现代经济过度强调证书和一致性的批判，而牺牲了真正的学习和理解。他们认为，这不仅对个人有害，而且与真正的知识驱动经济的需求不一致。

“大学使年轻人习惯于接受形式与内容、官方表述与现实之间的不匹配，这是对现代高等教育体系的批评。它认为，学生往往被教导要重视成绩、学位和其他正式的成功标志，而不是真正的学习和理解。这可能会让他们为一个官方工作描述和现实也可能出现分歧的职场做好准备。

以下是几个例子：

课程与现实世界的适用性：有时，大学课程中的课程可能非常理论化，对现实世界的直接适用性有限。例如，学生可以在微积分课程中学习抽象的数学概念。然而，如果他们进入一份需要数学知识的工作（比如工程师或精算师），他们可能会发现他们学到的具体理论很少在实践中使用。形式（课程内容）与实际情况（工作要求）不符。

分数膨胀：在许多大学中，存在一种被称为“分数膨胀”的现象，即对不一定符合这些标准的工作给予越来越高的分数。官方表述（等级）与实际情况（工作质量）不符。习惯了这一点的学生如果进入一份工作，可能不会感到惊讶，例如，无论他们的实际表现如何，每个人的绩效考核都“超出预期”。

研究与实践知识：许多课程，尤其是研究生课程，都非常注重研究。然而，在许多行业，实践经验和技能更受重视。学生可能会完成一篇关于一个非常小众的主题的论文，但发现他们所获得的具体知识与他们的工作无关或不适用。形式（以研究为重点的教育）与现实（以实用技能为重点的工作）不匹配。

官方课程描述与实际课程内容：有时，课程的官方描述听起来非常令人兴奋和创新，但课程的实际内容可能比预期的更世俗或传统。这可能会让学生习惯于一个工作场所，在那里，工作描述往往比工作的日常现实更迷人。

这些例子说明了高等教育如何让学生做好准备，接受你分享的文章中所说的形式和内容、官方表述和现实之间的不匹配。然而，需要注意的是，这些都是笼统的例子，可能不适用于每一所大学或每一个学生的经历。
